# quantum-machine-learning
This repository contains projects showcasing my skills in quantum machine learning. Using Qiskit and other frameworks, the projects cover a range of topics, including quantum neural networks and variational classifiers. Each project has code, docs, and its own directory. Ideal for those interested in quantum ML.
